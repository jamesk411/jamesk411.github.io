                My interests in the industry lie in the impact of software and technology in our everyday lives.
                Particularly, the roles of AI, databases, and computer security.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In an age where the goals of software are often questioned, especially regarding mental well-being, I would like to contribute in a more positive way.
                My interest is in developing human-centered technology by blending technical expertise with insights from psychology, design, and ethics.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Through this page, you'll find an overview of my projects and experiences.
                Thank you for your interest, and I look forward to exploring our potential connection.
